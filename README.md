# Delaunay-Art
The goal of this project is to create Triangulation Art using Python. Work is based off of the paper "Stylized Image Triangulation" by Lawonn and Gunther. It is a work in progress and I am looking to add
more features in the future.

Currently, the app works with the default image (starry_night). Future goals include: allowing the user to select an image from their computer, addding a save button to the program, and more!
