# Delaunay-Art
The goal of this project is to create Triangulation Art using Python. Work is based off of the paper "Stylized Image Triangulation" by Lawonn and Gunther. It is a work in progress and I am looking to add
more features in the future.

Currently, the app works with the default image (starry_night). Future goals include: allowing the user to select an image from their computer, addding a save button to the program, and more!

Guide:
MVC_GUI.py - Main application. Simply run the script and have fun!
GUI.py - Original iteration of the GUI. Changed it to use an MVC model for organization and readability.
Delaunay Art Generator version 3.py - The code completed as a part of a geometry project at the University of San Diego. Not user friendly, and was simply used to create art images for a showcase.
