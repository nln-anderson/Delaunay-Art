# Delaunay-Art
The goal of this project is to create Triangulation Art using Python. Work is based off of the paper "Stylized Image Triangulation" by Lawonn and Gunther. It is a work in progress and I am looking to add
more features in the future.

## Demonstration
![Starry Night Example]("C:\Users\nolio\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\ProgramGUI.png")

## File Guide
- MVC_GUI.py - Main application. Simply run the script and have fun! \
- GUI.py - Original iteration of the GUI. Changed it to use an MVC model for organization and readability. \
- Delaunay Art Generator version 3.py - The code completed as a part of a geometry project at the University of San Diego. Not user friendly, and was simply used to create art images for a showcase.

## How to Use
- Run the MVC_GUI.py file
- Select number of sample points and generation type
- Hit generate to see new image
- Hit save to save the new file
- Change input image if needed
- Have fun!
